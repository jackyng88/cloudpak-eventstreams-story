# cloudpak-eventstreams-story (AWS S3 Specific)

## Overall Use Case and Goal - 
1. Now that you have an Event Streams instance installed on Cloud Pak for Integration on top of OpenShift Container Platform the goal of this story is to show a possible use case that we can use with this technology.
2. With IBM Event Streams we have access to the powerful capabilities of Kafka in addition to all the monitoring and logging capabilities that IBM provides on top of that with Event Streams.
3. We will create a simple Quarkus (a super sonic and sub-atomic Kubernetes native framework for Java) application that utilizes MicroProfile Reactive Messaging in order for us to send a stream of data to our Event Streams/Kafka topic.
4. After that we will use the capabilities of the Strimzi Operator on OpenShift to deploy a KafkaConnect S2I cluster and also AWS S3 Sink and Source connectors built using the Apache Camel KafkaConnect binaries. From our Quarkus application we will send messages to an Inbound (Sink) topic which will trigger the Camel S3 Sink Connector to pull from that topic and put that data into an AWS S3 Bucket. We will then have the Camel S3 Sink Connector pull from the AWS S3 bucket and place the contents into an Outbound (Source) Topic. We will follow the steps outlined here [Kafka Connect to S3 Sink & Source](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-eda/scenarios/connect-s3/)


## Pre-requisites - 
1. OpenShift Container Platform Cluster - This story will assume you have a 4.x Cluster.
2. Cloud Pak for Integration - This will assume you have probably at least a 2019.4.1 or 2020.x.x release of the Cloud Pak for Integration installed on OpenShift. This story will also assume you have followed the installation instructions for Event Streams outlined here from the [Cloud Pak Playbook](https://cloudpak8s.io/integration/cp4i-deploy-eventstreams/) and have a working Event Streams instance.
3. Java Development Kit (JDK) v1.8+
4. Apache Maven v3.6.2+
5. An IDE of your choice 
6. An AWS Account.
   - An IAM user with AmazonS3FullAccess Policy
   - An S3 Bucket policy so we can perform actions on the S3 bucket.


## Creating the Quarkus with MicroProfile Reactive Messaging Application - 
1. Create the Quarkus project. You can replace <> and the contents inside of <> with whatever you would like.

```
mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:1.4.2.Final:create \
    -DprojectGroupId=<org.acme> \
    -DprojectArtifactId=<quarkus-kafka> \
    -Dextensions="kafka"
```

2. Open the project in your IDE of choice. 

3. Create the following folder structure and then create the Producer.java file.

```
src/main/java/org/acme/kafka/producer/Producer.java
```
